										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Department of Health urges members of the public to be extra vigilant of mpox symptoms as three more laboratory-confirmed cases of the disease are detected in Ekurhuleni, Gauteng province. The newly detected positive cases include a 38-year old man who presented to the healthcare facility with symptoms of mpox.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The other two confirmed mpox are a 14-year old man and 33-year old woman who are both contacts of the other patient. None of the patients have recent travel history to countries or regions currently experiencing mpox an outbreak, which suggests there is ongoing local transmission of the virus in the country. This also highlights the necessity of rapid and well-coordinated contact-tracing for early detection and effective management of positive cases.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This increases the total cumulative number of positive cases from 28 to 31 cases since the outbreak in May 2024. The number includes six cases recorded since the beginning of this year. The patients are currently self-isolating and receiving appropriate clinical management from the healthcare workers. The Department has activated outbreak response teams in the province for contact tracing and case investigation in the affected areas. Mpox is typically a mild and self-limiting disease with a low case fatality rate. The risk of wider transmission remains low in South Africa, but anyone can contract mpox regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation and race.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, all three new mpox patients also tested positive for relatively unknown, but common virus called herpes simplex virus (HSV). This is a viral infection that causes painful blisters or ulcers which mainly spreads through skin-to-skin contact including kissing and unprotected sex, hence consistent and correct use of condoms remains the best way to prevent genital herpes and other STIs. The virus is generally asymptomatic, treatable, but not curable. The symptoms include a rash which may last for 2 &#8211; 4 weeks, fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, low energy and swollen glands.</p>

In October 2024, the National Department of Health (NDoH) was advised by Bayer (Pty) Ltd of the depletion of stock for the public sector of praziquantel (Biltricide) 600mg tablets; 10 tablets item specification.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">NDoH has sourced stock of alternative pack-size (available at the end of April 2025) and has issued a communication on 12 March 2025, to provincial depot managers and heads of pharmaceutical services advising on stock procurement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Public-sector queries can be directed to Anzelde Willemse at 066 261 4234 or <a href="mailto:anzelde.willemse@health.gov.za">anzelde.willemse@health.gov.za</a>. Private-sector counterparts are advised to contact Bayer (Pty) Ltd directly as they are the only registered supplier of praziquantel in South Africa.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Schistosomiasis is classified as a category two notifiable medical condition, meaning it must be reported within seven days of clinical or laboratory diagnosis. Healthcare providers and laboratories are required to report confirmed cases of schistosomiasis to the via the Notifiable Medical Conditions system through written or electronic notification.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Reporting schistosomiasis cases is crucial for monitoring the disease&#8217;s prevalence, identifying transmission sites, and implementing effective control measures.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Between 1 January 2024 and 9 March 2025, 31 confirmed cases of respiratory diphtheria and 38 asymptomatic carriers of toxigenic <em>C. diphtheriae</em>, detected during contact tracing, have been identified in South Africa. The majority of confirmed cases and carriers (93%, 64/69) were from the Western Cape, comprising 28 respiratory diphtheria cases and 36 asymptomatic carriers. The median age of cases of confirmed respiratory diphtheria was 31 years (range: 3–51 years), with 77% (24/31) aged over 18 years and the case-fatality ratio was 23% (7/31).</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #008000;">Highlights:</span></h4>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Since the last situational report (week 9), the following updates are included in this report:<br />
o No new laboratory-confirmed cases of toxigenic respiratory diphtheria<br />
o Two asymptomatic carriers of toxigenic C. diphtheriae, one from the Western Cape and one from Mpumalanga</li>
<li>Appropriate public health responses have been initiated for each case</li>
</ul>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #008000;">Information for clinicians</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Respiratory diphtheria is a vaccine-preventable illness caused by toxigenic <em>C. diphtheriae</em> (and more rarely <em>C. ulcerans</em> or <em>C. pseudotuberculosis</em>), and can occur in persons of all ages.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The clinical presentation includes the following signs and symptoms:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>sore throat</li>
<li>low-grade fever</li>
<li>AND an adherent membrane of the nose, pharynx, tonsils, or larynx (Figure 2) &#8211; the membrane is greyish-white and firmly adherent to the tissue</li>
<li> AND/OR enlarged glands in the neck (bull neck)</li>
<li> toxin-mediated systemic signs including myocarditis, polyneuropathy and renal damage</li>
</ul>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #008000;">Patient management</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Treatment includes antibiotics (azithromycin or penicillin) to clear the organism from the throat and prevent onward transmission, and diphtheria anti-toxin (DAT) to neutralise unbound toxin. The dosage of DAT is determined by the duration and severity of illness. Treatment, contact tracing and chemoprophylaxis should be started prior to laboratory confirmation. Early administration of DAT may be life-saving and should not be delayed in cases with a high index of suspicion. Supportive care is primarily aimed at airway management and includes providing oxygen, monitoring with electrocardiogram and intubation or performance of a tracheostomy if necessary.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">On 21 February, a case of mpox was confirmed in a patient from Gauteng Province. This is the first case of mpox recorded in South Africa for 2025, and the first since August 2024. Furthermore, it was confirmed that the patient has been infected with Clade I mpox virus, which is currently circulating in the Democratic Republic of Congo and has been reported in travellers returning to many locations around the globe. In this case, the patient had a recent travel history to Kampala, Uganda which would explain the source of the exposure to the virus. Through contact tracing and monitoring a further two cases of mpox was linked to this case and confirmed by laboratory testing. Both cases involve close contacts of the index case. All three cases are now recovering and self-isolating at home.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Globally mpox continues to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern , as well as a Public Health Emergency of Continental Security in Africa (Africa CDC, 2024). The mpox outbreak is ongoing in thirteen out of 22 countries in Africa, with Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo currently reporting the highest number of cases. Outside of Africa, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Mauritius, Pakistan, Philippines, Sweden, Sultanate of Oman, Thailand, The United Arab Emirates (UAE), United States (U.S), United Kingdom (UK), South Sudan, United Arab Emirates and have each reported one confirmed case of clade I mpox. No additional secondary cases have been reported following the initial cases excluding those in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">South Africa remains at risk for introduction of mpox cases through travellers returning from various locations around the globe where mpox is being reported. Mpox is typically a mild and self-limiting disease with a low case fatality rate. More severe disease, and fatal outcomes, are typically found in persons living with immunodeficiencies, in particular HIV/AIDS. For more information on mpox and how the spread of the disease can be prevented, visit the NICD website at <a href="http://www.nicd.ac.za.">www.nicd.ac.za.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Department of Health would like to urge the public to take extra care as the country records three laboratory-confirmed cases of mpox. The first case was confirmed on 21 February in a 30-year-old male patient residing in Ekurhuleni, Gauteng Province with a recent travel history to Kampala, Uganda. The patient was diagnosed with Clade I mpox virus, which is currently circulating in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda and has been reported in travellers returning to many locations around the globe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The other two cases, a 30-year-old male and a 27-year-old female, also from Ekurhuleni, were detected through contact tracing and monitoring conducted by outbreak response teams. This highlights the importance of information sharing by primary cases for contact tracing. All three cases are now recovering and self-isolating at home. This increases the total cumulative number of positive cases from 25 to 28 cases, including three deaths since the outbreak in May last year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These are the first positive cases of mpox recorded in South Africa this year, and the last case was recorded in September 2024. Globally, mpox continues to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and Public Health Emergency of Continental Security (PHECS) as per the declarations by both the World Health Organization and Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in August 2024.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is no need for public to panic, but people are urged to remain cautious of how mpox spreads and to seek help when faced with symptoms of mpox. The symptoms include a rash which may last for 2 &#8211; 4 weeks, fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, low energy and swollen glands. Mpox is typically a mild and self-limiting disease with a low case fatality rate. The risk of wider transmission remains low in South Africa, but anyone can contract mpox regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation and race.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Department urges all people experiencing any of the symptoms, with or without travel history to countries and regions experiencing mpox outbreaks, or who had close contact with known mpox patients to seek medical care. Although, the country has limited stock of mpox specific vaccine for treatment of patients who experience severe health complications as a result of this disease.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Safer sex and personal hygiene practices are among the most effective preventative methods to control further spread of the disease. People are therefore reminded to always wash hands with soap and water, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, especially before eating or after using the toilet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Between 1 January 2024 and 23 February 2025, 29 confirmed cases of respiratory diphtheria and 33 asymptomatic carriers of toxigenic <em>C. diphtheriae</em>, detected during contact tracing, have been identified in South Africa. The majority of confirmed cases and carriers (95%, 59/62) were from the Western Cape, comprising 27 respiratory diphtheria cases and 32 asymptomatic carriers. The median age of cases of confirmed respiratory diphtheria was 28 years (range: 3–67 years), with 75% (22/29) aged over 18 years and the case-fatality ratio was 21% (6/29).</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #008000;">Highlights:</span></h4>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Since the last situational report (week 7), the following updates are included in this report:<br />
o 3 new laboratory-confirmed cases of toxigenic respiratory diphtheria from the Western Cape.<br />
o 6 asymptomatic carriers of toxigenic <em>C. diphtheriae</em> from the Western Cape.</li>
<li>Appropriate public health responses have been initiated for each case.</li>
</ul>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #008000;">Information for clinicians</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Respiratory diphtheria is a vaccine-preventable illness caused by toxigenic <em>C. diphtheriae</em> (and more rarely <em>C. ulcerans</em> or <em>C. pseudotuberculosis</em>), and can occur in persons of all ages.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The clinical presentation includes the following signs and symptoms:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>sore throat</li>
<li>low-grade fever</li>
<li>AND an adherent membrane of the nose, pharynx, tonsils, or larynx (Figure 2) &#8211; the membrane is<br />
greyish-white and firmly adherent to the tissue</li>
<li> AND/OR enlarged glands in the neck (bull neck)</li>
<li> toxin-mediated systemic signs including myocarditis, polyneuropathy and renal damage</li>
</ul>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #008000;">Patient management</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Treatment includes antibiotics (azithromycin or penicillin) to clear the organism from the throat and prevent onward transmission, and diphtheria anti-toxin (DAT) to neutralise unbound toxin. The dosage of DAT is determined by the duration and severity of illness. Treatment, contact tracing and chemoprophylaxis should be started prior to laboratory confirmation. Early administration of DAT may be life-saving and should not be delayed in cases with a high index of suspicion. Supportive care is primarily aimed at airway management and includes providing oxygen, monitoring with electrocardiogram and intubation or performance of a tracheostomy if necessary.</p>

The majority of confirmed cases and carriers (94%, 50/53) were from the Western Cape, comprising 24 respiratory diphtheria cases and 26 asymptomatic carriers. The median age of cases of confirmed respiratory diphtheria was 28 years (range: 3–42 years), with 73% (19/26) aged over 18 years and the case-fatality ratio was 23% (6/26).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From 1 January 2024 to 16 February 2025, 179 individuals have been reported as suspected diphtheria cases and tested negative for toxigenic. diphtheriae. Alternate diagnoses became available for some of the individuals with suspected diphtheria, and included Streptococcus pyogenes, Corynebacterium spp NOT diphtheriae, Ludwig’s angina, retrobulbar abscess or respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV-2.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #008000;">Highlights:</span></h4>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>In the last epidemiologic week (week 7), the following number of new cases were reported:<br />
o 1 laboratory-confirmed case of toxigenic respiratory diphtheria in the Western Cape<br />
o 7 asymptomatic carriers of toxigenic C. diphtheriae in the Western Cape<br />
o No suspected respiratory diphtheria cases were reported from other provinces</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Department of Health calls for calm following an outbreak of Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD) in KwaZulu-Natal province, mostly around Durban. The Department, working with the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) is closely monitoring the situation while providing necessary support to the province to contain the spread of this fairly common viral infection, which mainly affects infants and children.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is no need for the public to panic because the outbreak remains under control and at the current moment there is no serious public health threat detected. However, parents and caregivers are urged to be vigilant in case their children display common symptoms such as fever, sore throat, tiredness, loss of appetite and small blisters on the inside of the mouth, sides of the tongue, palms of the hands and soles of the feet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A small minority of individuals with HFMD may need to be admitted to hospital for treatment of complications. Infected individuals with severe disease or complications must go to the nearest healthcare facility.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The infection is usually self-limiting and clears without medication after 7 to 10 days. This means that one can recover without taking treatment or medication. Parents are urged to keep symptomatic children at home until they recover to prevent further spread of the disease.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hygiene practices are some of the most effective preventative and control methods to contain the spread of the disease, hence educators and parents are encouraged to promote good hygiene habits at homes and school environment including regular hand-washing, covering mouth when coughing, regularly cleaning surfaces and not sharing eating utensils and stationery.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Department has been inundated with enquiries from the media and members of the community about the outbreak and possible health threat. The disease is caused by a group of viruses known as enteroviruses, and it mainly occurs in small outbreaks at schools, crèches and day-care centres during the summer and autumn months.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">HFMD spreads from person-to-person by direct contact or by droplets from the mouth or nose of an infected person. The virus may also be spread through contaminated objects (e.g. toys, stationery) and faeces. Children under the age of 10 years are at greatest risk of infection. It is not common in adults, but people with weak immune systems may be prone to infection.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">HFMD affects humans and it is completely different from foot-and-mouth disease, otherwise known as hoof-and-mouth disease which mainly affects farm animals like sheep and cattle. Thus, the two diseases are not related and are caused by different viruses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although, HFMD is not part of the notifiable medical conditions, the Department remains on high alert to monitor the number of cases in KZN and to detect outbreaks, if experienced, in other parts of the country.</p>
